# 🜁 Project Euclid

**Euclid** is a modern, modular geometry kernel built from first principles for high-performance computational design. It is designed to be the mathematical foundation for a next-generation CAD ecosystem.

## 🏗️ TODO

## ⚙️ Core Linear Algebra Infrastructure

- [x] `Metric`

## 📐 Geometry Primitives

- [x] `Point`
- [x] `Line`
- [x] `Curve`
- [x] `Plane`
- [x] `Face`
