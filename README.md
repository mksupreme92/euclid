# 🜁 Project Euclid

**Euclid** is a modern, modular geometry kernel built from first principles for high-performance computational design. It is designed to be the mathematical foundation for a next-generation CAD ecosystem.

## 🏗️ TODO

## ⚙️ Core Linear Algebra Infrastructure

- [x] `Metric`

## 📐 Geometry Primitives

- [x] `Point`
- [ ] `Line`
    - need to revisit logic for intersection tests & implement line segments, otherwise complete  
- [x] `Curve` - Parametric Linear & Nonlinear Curves
- [x] `Plane`
- [x] `Face`
- [x] `Surface` 
- [ ] `Volume` ((ℝ³ → ℝⁿ))

## 🧮 Operations on Geometry Primitives
- [x] `Transformations` - Affine, Linear, Orthagonal, Special Orthagonal, Projective
- [ ] `Boolean Operations` — Boolean operations (union, subtract, intersect)
- [ ] `Collisions` — Collision and intersection logic

## ✒️ Elementa Programing Language API

- [ ] `Elementa` —  layer for input to kernel
